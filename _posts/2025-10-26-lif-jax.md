In the [last tutorial](/posts/2025/10/lif-theory/) we looked at the theory of implementing a LIF neuron. Now we will put it into code with JAX.

If you are unfamiliar with JAX, you can think of it as a fancy numpy for the scope of this tutorial. In the future we will see that it also does autodiff and other things.
