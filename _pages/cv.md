Recently my work has been in the field of Neuromorphic Computing or at the Chair of Data Science in Hagen. The latter involved a variety of ML tasks. Prior to this I was a Software Developer, working in typical SCRUM teams or whatever the project required. I manage my code in Git and try to find scalable solutions whenever possible.
