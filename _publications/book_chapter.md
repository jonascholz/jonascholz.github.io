**Abstract**:
This chapter provides an introduction to common methods of anomaly detection, which is an important aspect of quality control in manufacturing. We give an overview of widely used statistical methods for detecting anomalies based on k-means, decision trees, and Support Vector Machines. In addition, we examine the more recent deep learning technique of autoencoders. We conclude our chapter with a case study from the EU project knowlEdge, where an autoencoder was utilized in order to detect anomalies in a manufacturing process of fuel tanks. Throughout the chapter, we emphasize the importance of humans-in-the-loop and provide an example of how AI can be used to improve manufacturing processes.
