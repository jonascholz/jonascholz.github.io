The project's goal was to create a fully integrated AI pipeline, covering all steps of the development process. That means data is automatically collected, processed analysed and so on. In the end, ML models make some predictions, such as detecting anomalies or calculating production schedules. The point is that it's all automatic or "zero-touch", as it was often called. The image below shows its architecture.

I didn't come up with the architecture, or anything of note to be honest. By the time I joined, everything was already well in motion and I did some work on unsupervised ML work. Pretty neat experience overall.
