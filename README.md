# Academic Pages

![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)

Academic Pages is a Github Pages template for academic websites and this is my fork. I only adjusted the styles sligthly and the rest is unchanged.

# Run `jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.
