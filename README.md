# Academic Pages

![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)

Academic Pages is a Github Pages template for academic websites and this is my fork. Here are my changes:
- different header style
- name and short-bio are hidden on publications/cv page when user is on mobile
- added birthdate variable in _config.yml and automatically calculated age on about.md

# Run `jekyll serve -l -H localhost` to generate the HTML and serve it from `localhost:4000` the local server will automatically rebuild and refresh the pages on change.
